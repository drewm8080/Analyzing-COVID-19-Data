# Analyzing-COVID-19-Data
## **COVID-19DataSource**

Website: covid19datasource.usc.edu


In this repository, we go through three different data sources to create models to compare the data sources. The three different sources we use are:
1. The Covid-19 Tracking Project-- Reported cases,deaths and hospitalizations
2. Covid-19 Projections-- Estimated cases and deaths
3. Covidestim-- Estimated cases and deaths

# **How to use these files**
Simply run the whole code. The code will ask you for a state. Follow the direction given by the code and press enter. Scroll to the bottom and the statistics,table, and data visualizations will be generated.

# **Background to the models**
We used the Average Day of Case/Death/Hospitalization to compare the three sources goes as follows:

Next, we looked at the ratios,difference of Average Day of Death/Hospitalization and Average Day of Case, and finally the CDFs of cases,deaths, and hospitalizations.

Through these metrics, we can compare states cases/deaths and get some insights:

1. Is the state reporting cases/deaths late?
2. How reliable is the data sources?
3. Is there discrepancies in the data?

We can compare the two estimated data sources (Covidestim and Covid-19 Projections) with the reported data (The COVID-19 Tracking Project) to get a better sense of the data. 

# **Data Visualization Example**

Here is some example data visualizations for Florida from The Covid-19 Tracking Project:
