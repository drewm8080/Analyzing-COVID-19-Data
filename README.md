NOTE: This is an on-going repository and is constantly being updated. 

**Tracking COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the United States: Distribution of Events by Day of Pandemic**: [Research Paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.21262851v1)

In this repository, we go through three different data sources to create models to compare the data sources. The three different sources we use are:
1. [CDC Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36)-- Reported cases and deaths
2. [Covid-19 Projections](https://covid19-projections.com/)-- Estimated cases and deaths
3. [Covidestim](https://covidestim.org/)-- Estimated cases and deaths
